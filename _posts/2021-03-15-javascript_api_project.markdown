I have built this app to be used by a vendor of fish, to keep track of which customer purchased which fish. I will admit, this was not the way I expected the app to work when I first began it, but as I found myself working deeper, I realized I had taken on too large of a scope for a Flatiron project! I feel this project's main purpose is to demonstrate a competency with creating a Rails API backend and a JavaScript frontend which communicate with one another and allow users to interact with our code in a user-friendly way. In that respect, I feel I have succeeded with this project.

Using several different AJAX calls, the frontend communicates with the API to create, show, and destroy buyers and fish, allowing users to manipulate the database through simple interaction with the database. I decided to create a select tag in the form to create a new fish which would list all buyer ids which exist within the API. This was the challenge I spent the most time working on during this project. As I dove deeper and deeper into the problem, I realized what a good learning experience it was. I could no longer take any line of code for granted- I was forced to learn the nuts and bolts. As I combed over my code, I finally had my eureka! moment (though I am embarasssed to admit it...I had mistakenly been using the wrong id in a getElementById call.) All in all, I found the experience greatly sharpened my skills as a programmer who wants to be able to work well in both sides of development.
