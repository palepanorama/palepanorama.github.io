Growing up, I was always told that computers were the future. "You should go into tech!" was such a ubiquitous piece of unsolicited advice that I began to resent the very idea. When I entered college, I decided I would enter a discipline which I believed to be divorced from the world of computers: philosophy. Entering the workforce with a liberal arts degree in hand did not present to me the challenges I was always warned of; I soon found myself employed in a managerial position for a pest control company my wife and I had our firstborn, and we purchased a home to start our fledgling family in. Life was good, but I had begun to feel unfulfilled in my career. 

When the time came for the company I was with to do an overhaul on its website, my curiosity in web development was piqued. I began scouring the Internet in my downtime, studying the basics of HTML and CSS (later on, elementary JavaScript) and attempting to put them into practice as a fun exercise. What a shock it was to me, the technophobic philosophy major, to discover that coding is its own symbolic logic! In a sense, I felt I was doing philosophy whenever I would code. After this realization, I was enamored with the prospect of diving deeper and deeper into development. If I could make a career out of it, all the better! 

When COVID-19 began to impact our lives, I was faced with the choice to take an indefinite leave of absence or work through a pandemic with a toddler at home. I chose the former and decided it was time for a permanent career transition into software engineering. After research, I decided Flatiron would be the best opportunity for me to achieve that goal. Here I am!
