I have struggled with this project to decide on an appropriate scope. In brainstorming ideas over Christmas, a dear friend who runs a fishing operation out of Destin, Florida suggested that I build an application through which he could sell fish openly online, as this is something he is interested in doing. 'Great idea!' I thought. Initially, I planned to have an application which would allow users to visit the site and select from available stock and add them into a cart which could be processed and shipped by the vendor. It didn't take long before I realized that I had bit off more than I could chew within the time constrains of project week! 

As I worked through my project, I reconceptualized it as an application for the vendor to use and keep track of what fish had been purchased by which buyer and compile these into a list. This seemed much more appropriate to do for a homework project- I wish I had considered seriously this at the start of the project. The application is designed for the user (vendor) to be able to create new buyers and fish, then assign these fish to the buyers through a has many relationship. The user is also able to delete users and fish, presumably after the order has been filled. Not a very practical app as it stands, but given time I believe I could craft this into a full service application for both vendors and buyers.
